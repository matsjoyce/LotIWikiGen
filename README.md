Usage
-----

You need Python 3.5+ and Unix-like system to run this generator

```bash
python3 -m loti_wiki_gen <LotI path>
```

The `<LotI path>` is the path to the Legend of the Invincibles root directory and is `~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.12/data/add-ons/Legend_of_the_Invincibles/` on unix systems. You can also use a cloned copy of https://github.com/Dugy/Legend_of_the_Invincibles. This will generate the following files:

 - `items.wiki`
 - `standard_advancements.wiki`
 - `unit_advancements.wiki`
 - `abilities.wiki`

These files correspond to the wiki pages listed above, and are in `text/x-wiki` format.

The script can upload the updated pages using the `--autoupload` flag (this requires requests and BeautifulSoup4) but **DO NOT DO THIS WITHOUT PERMISSION**. We do not want an automated edit war breaking out.

Requirements
------------

 - `git`
 - `python3.4+`
 - For `--autoupload`:
     - `requests`
     - `bs4`
