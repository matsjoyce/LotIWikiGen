The wiki generator for the LotI docs at https://wiki.wesnoth.org/

LotI wiki pages generated by this script:

 - https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LotI_Items &ndash; items, such as weapons and books
 - https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LotI_Standard_Advancements &ndash; general advancements such as legacies and books
 - https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LotI_Unit_Advancements &ndash; unit specific advancements
 - https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LotI_Abilities &ndash; abilities and weapon specials

Other useful pages:

 - https://github.com/Dugy/Legend_of_the_Invincibles
 - https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=32384

Usage
-----

```bash
python3 -m loti_wiki_gen <LotI path>
```

The `<LotI path>` is the path to the Legend of the Invincibles root directory and is `~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.12/data/add-ons/Legend_of_the_Invincibles/` on unix systems. You can also use a cloned copy of https://github.com/Dugy/Legend_of_the_Invincibles. This will generate the following files:

 - `items.wiki`
 - `standard_advancements.wiki`
 - `unit_advancements.wiki`
 - `abilities.wiki`

These files correspond to the wiki pages listed above, and are in `text/x-wiki` format.

The script can upload the updated pages using the `--autoupload` flag (this requires requests and BeautifulSoup4) but **DO NOT DO THIS WITHOUT PERMISSION**. We do not want an automated edit war breaking out.

Requirements
------------

 - `git`
 - `python3.4+`
 - For `--autoupload`:
     - `requests`
     - `bs4`
