If they lead an army into a battle that shows to be going to be a defeat, they betray their soldiers and flee into safety or trick the winners that they were helping them all the time.

<span style='color:#808080'><i>Gods are legendary beings living from humans' worship. They are greatly powerful and usually out of our reach, but sometimes even gods give birth to children with humans. Their children retain some of their power, but this power fades over generation.

== Champion ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>After hundreds of battles and duels, the survivor learns that victory is not as important as survival. The best warrior is not the one who kills the most enemies, but the one who survives the most battles. Even with fewer kills per battle, the one who lives longer will eventually kill more people than fighters who kill enemies in large numbers. And the secret of survival is proper defence. Even in duels, the winner is the one who does not get hit, not the one who can hit the best.<br/>
Those who understand this rule learn to defend extremely well and become so legendary in duels that even kings call them their champions in various occasions, like trials by combat. Sometimes they even adapt to wearing a light armour to protect themselves.<br/>
Gameplay notes:<br/>
This unit is highly defensive and focused on counterattacks, not on damage.<br/>
Advancements are defense-oriented, this unit's potential in avoiding hits is the greatest of all units.<br/>
Special Notes: This unit’s skill at skirmishing allows it to ignore enemies’ zones of control and thus move unhindered around them.<br/>

== Dark Shade ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Dark shade is a spirit of something so dark that it was not allowed to exist in the real world. Only its shadow appears on walls and attacks the shadows of its victims - and the victims will get hurt too.<br/>
Special Notes: If there is an enemy of the target on the opposite side of the target while attacking it, this unit may backstab, inflicting double damage by creeping around behind that enemy. Spirits have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. This unit is able to hide at night, leaving no trace of its presence. This unit’s skill at skirmishing allows it to ignore enemies’ zones of control and thus move unhindered around them. During battle, this unit can drain life from victims to renew its own health.<br/>

== Demigod (Efraim God) ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Half-gods are things so rare, that nobody ever cared to describe their full powers.<br/>
Special notes: Telling everything a half-god can do would be too lengthy. But a matter to consider is that they have developed compassion out of a desire to save their wretched enemies from sins, pain, suffering and misery, they are able to redeem tormented souls. Even if this 'redeem attack' can be used only once every three turns.<br/>
Gameplay notes:<br/>
It is imperative to use the redeem attack from time to time. After redeeming a certain amount of enemies, redeem becomes more effective (possibly also a good offensive weapon) and the unit gains a new advancement line of choice. Some of them add new spells, others add new abilities. Spells gained have huge ranges, incomparable to other spells, and converge into Particle storm, an attack hitting many enemies and dealing severe arcane damage. Physical abilities converge into Spiritual Transformation, that is an attack that makes the unit attack a single target with huge damage and taking only 33% of the damage.<br/>
Without these advancements, the unit will never get particularly strong, and low level enemies may become rare to find.<br/>
The leadership is equal to the leadership of a level 5 unit.<br/>

== Demigod (Lethalia God) ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Half-gods are things so rare, that nobody ever cared to describe their full powers.<br/>
Special notes: Telling everything a half-god can do would be too lengthy. But a matter to consider is that they have developed compassion out of a desire to save their wretched enemies from sins, pain, suffering and misery, they are able to redeem tormented souls. Even if this 'redeem attack' can be used only once every three turns.<br/>
Gameplay notes:<br/>
It is imperative to use the redeem attack from time to time. After redeeming a certain amount of enemies, redeem becomes more effective (possibly also a good offensive weapon) and the unit gains a new advancement line of choice. Some of them add new spells, others add new abilities. Spells gained have huge ranges, incomparable to other spells, and converge into Particle storm, an attack hitting many enemies and dealing severe arcane damage. Physical abilities converge into Spiritual Transformation, that is an attack that makes the unit attack a single target with huge damage and taking only 33% of the damage.<br/>
Without these advancements, the unit will never get particularly strong, and low level enemies may become rare to find.<br/>
This unit also has god AMLA advancements</i></span>

== Duke ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>If those who have earned the title of Grand Marshal are fearsome, those leaders of battle known as Dukes make them seem like lowly corporals. Few other commanders leave such a great mark on battlefield and state alike, as the sheer strategic prowess of the Duke inevitably carries over into political life. Though some may best him in single combat, few have ever triumphed over a Duke in charge of a full army; not only can he exhort those in his command to greater efficiency as a unit, his mere presence is enough to stir his troops to rash death-or-glory charges against the enemy.<br/>
Special Notes: The leadership of this unit enables adjacent units of the same side to deal more damage in combat, though this only applies to units of lower level. This unit can fanaticise all units adjacent to him into a frenzy, making them deal and take double damage, but only offensively.<br/>

== Dwarvish Battlerager ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Dwarvish Lords are always thinking about ways to make their army more powerful. One of their frequent decisions is that Berserkers, a rare caste of Dwarves, who work themselves into a towering rage before combat, disdain all notion of defense, thinking only of the unrelenting assaults for which they are legendary, should wear armours. Berserkers usually refuse, because armour would prevent them from attacking as strongly as possible. Sometimes a cunning Dwarvish Lord decides to forge an armour to appeal to them. These armours are black, heavy, and there is a lot of spikes on them, that attires the attention of any Berserker. Clad in a spiky armour, a Berserker becomes a Battlerager, an even more scary warrior than Berserkers.<br/>
Special Notes: Whenever its berserk attack is used, this unit continues to push the attack until either it or its enemy lies dead.<br/>

Elder Magi are the real masters of magic, the ones who make new spells and truly understand the arcane. Even if they are not trained for battle, their powerful magic can destroy most enemies before the need for quick reflexes comes.<br/>

== Fencer ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Fencers belong to a school of thought that considers the armor most soldiers wear in combat to be their own worst enemy. While armor can only soften a blow, evading it leaves the defender completely unharmed. Being able to reliably dodge any offensive move is a luxury only afforded to the fit of body, and then only to those who endure rigorous training.<br/>
Outfitted with only a dagger and saber, fencers are light on their feet and useful in many situations where their armor-bound peers are at a disadvantage. They relish dancing circles around troops like heavy infantry, mocking the weight of their full armor.<br/>
Special Notes: This unit’s skill at skirmishing allows it to ignore enemies’ zones of control and thus move unhindered around them. This unit’s arcane attack deals tremendous damage to magical creatures, and even some to mundane creatures. This unit has magical attacks, which always have a high chance of hitting an opponent.</i></span>

== Orcish Strafer ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Orcs are generally believed to be simple-minded and unable even to manufacture their crossbows. But it is wrong. The intellect of orcs is not inferior by any means, but they usually prefer not to use it. But competition and battle prowess is usually far the greatest motivation, and if better gear looks like a possibility to get stronger, they start thinking about improvements. One of their inventions is the slurbow, some orcs get them from plunder, some manufacture them themselves. However, even slurbows are not the best, and some creative orcs in times of peace manage to improve it so that it can be operated with a single hand. This way, they can carry two ranged weapons into battle, and devastate most enemies with their deadly and quick shots.<br/>

== Preserved Lich (Efraim Lich) ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Preserved liches are an exotic kind of liches, they are far more powerful than mere liches.<br/>
Gameplay notes:<br/>
Advancements with sword add marksman, plague, and berserk-like attacks.<br/>
Advancements with whirlwind gain bonuses from sword advancements, and depend on advancements with sword.<br/>
Advancements with throwing knives are a potent source of weapon-related ranged damage, it may gain backstab.<br/>
Advancements with wave of fear bring huge damage, slow, explosive slow, leech, and after taking a lot of advancements also explosive damage.<br/>
Don't neglect defensive abilities. They stack additively with gear, while the effects of different parts of armour stack only multiplicatively.<br/>
The soul eater ability will add a lot of other advancements (new attacks, regeneration, healing, various abilities and much more).<br/>
Try to avoid learning from books, because while normal advancements add 20 to maximum experience to preserved liches, these advancements add 20% to maximum experience; that might later be an equivalent even to five advancements.<br/>
Special Notes: This unit regenerates, which allows it to heal as though always stationed in a village. This unit can move unseen in deep water, requiring no air from the surface. The victims of this unit’s poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a unit which cures. This unit has magical attacks, which always have a high chance of hitting an opponent. During battle, this unit can drain life from victims to renew its own health.<br/>

== Preserved Lich (Lethalia Lich) ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Preserved liches are an exotic kind of liches, they are far more powerful than mere liches.<br/>
Gameplay notes:<br/>
Advancements with staff add plague, damage and precision.<br/>
Advancements with axe unlock a very useful whirlwind attack, and that unlocks most advancements with axe, many advancements with axe improve also whirlwind.<br/>
Advancements with faerie fire mostly improve damage; one of them removes swarm, but decreases the number of attacks significantly.<br/>
Advancements with gossamer add various weapon specials to it, but its damage is inferior.<br/>
Don't neglect defensive abilities. They stack additively with gear, while the effects of different parts of armour stack only multiplicatively.<br/>
The soul eater ability will add a lot of other advancements (new attacks, regeneration, healing, various abilities and much more).<br/>
Try to avoid learning from books, because while normal advancements add 20 to maximum experience to preserved liches, these advancements add 20% to maximum experience; that might later be an equivalent even to five advancements.<br/>
Special Notes: This unit regenerates, which allows it to heal as though always stationed in a village. This unit can move unseen in deep water, requiring no air from the surface. The swarming attacks of this unit become less deadly whenever its members are wounded. This unit has magical attacks, which always have a high chance of hitting an opponent. During battle, this unit can drain life from victims to renew its own health. This unit is capable of healing those around it, and curing them of poison.<br/>
This unit also has soul eater AMLA advancements</i></span>

Gameplay notes: This unit can learn to use a dark breath that can, along with its jaws, turn this skeletal dragon into a doom to all living.<br/>

== Snow Hunter ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Having lost their ancient homeland in forests after the Fall, some elves remained seeking last remains of forests and eventually found them in the north, but others tried to adopt to other areas.

Because of the constant danger and harsh weather condition the Snow Elves live in, they are all trained for battle and skilled in usage of weapons. Thanks to their fast metabolism, they are highly resistant to frost, capable to sit half-naked in a circle and chat in freezing temperatures.

== Werewolf Rider ==
<span style='color:#808080'><i>Sometimes it happens that an orc grows really unintelligent and naive, but blessed with extraordinary strength and predator-like instincts and ferocity. They have great difficulties with integration into the orcish community, but shamans usually perform a ritual that allows them to transform their body to the shape of an animal, which lets them use their innate abilities better. It is said that those orcs have the legacy of their beast ancestors of distant past and are considered sacred. They abandon orcish communities and hunt in the wilderness. They shift back into the humanoid form only rarely, usually only when they need to climb somewhere. Those orcs are half-men and half-beasts and are nearly impossible to tame. However, sometimes there are also battle-hardened and experienced goblin riders who are ambitious enough to search for those werewolves and even manage to tame one enough to ride with him into battle. Those goblins are called werewolf riders and whenever they appear on a battlefield, they strike fear into the hearts of their foes and are even respected by the greatest of the orcs.<br/>
